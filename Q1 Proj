create a mad-lib style game about a Jesuittopic.
Write a program which must contain at least 100 lines of code (150 for groups of 2) and incorporate a
minimum of 30 blanks (50 for groups of 2). Be sure to use comments in the program to help anyone reviewing
the code understand how each part operates. Comments, blank lines, and unnecessary or logically repetitive
lines of code will not contribute towards the overall program line count.
